DistanceVector algorithm since 2015_fall_semester at Computer_Network_class

enviorment : win8, java 1.8

input : netMap.conf.txt, router name(ex A)

output :  the progress of inserting and changing items of Distance Vector table in real time

* how to implement program :
 1. at same path, implement processes 5 times
 2. instruction : path> java -jar DistanceVector.jar netMap.conf.txt A(router name)
 3. in the first, initializing Dstance vector table occurrences. 
    after 15sec, value of table`s item is changed that recalculating the table outbreaks.
